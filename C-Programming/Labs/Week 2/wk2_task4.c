/*
Quickly write a program to test whether the following list of names are legal identifiers, or not.

List of names:
1. times10
2. 10times
3. _done
4. _10times
5. user name (<-- this name has a space between "user" and "name")
6. user.name (<-- this name has a "." between "user" and "name")
7. user_name
8. username

   (hint: declare a separate variable for each name and see which ones compile successfully, or not)
   
    For example:
	int times10;
	int 10times;
	â€¦etc
