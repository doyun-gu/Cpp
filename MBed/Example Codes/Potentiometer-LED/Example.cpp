/*
MCE - Example Programâ€œ Dimming an LED with a potentiometer

This program uses the Nucleo-64 board and the Application Shield.
The program uses the previously introduced LED class. It adds an implementation of a wrapper class to determine the functionality of a potentiometer, based on the AnalogIn API provided through Mbed.

The potentiometer is regularly sampled in the main function, with the value being used as part of a function to determine the total 'on-time' for the LED. The LED is turned off for a fixed period of time. Consequently, the program allows for a varying of the duty cycle of a periodic digital signal. The ratio of the 'on-time' to the 'off-time' consequently determines the brightness of the LED.
